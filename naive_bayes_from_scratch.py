'''
Instructions: Compute the probability of the words 'freedom' and 'immigration' being said in a speech, or
P(F,I).

The first step is multiplying the probabilities of Jill Stein giving a speech with her individual 
probabilities of saying the words 'freedom' and 'immigration'. Store this in a variable called p_j_text

The second step is multiplying the probabilities of Gary Johnson giving a speech with his individual 
probabilities of saying the words 'freedom' and 'immigration'. Store this in a variable called p_g_text

The third step is to add both of these probabilities and you will get P(F,I).

# P(J)
p_j = 0.5

# P(F/J)
p_j_f = 0.1

# P(I/J)
p_j_i = 0.1

p_j_text = p_j * p_j_f * p_j_i
print(p_j_text)

# P(G)
p_g = 0.5

# P(F/G)
p_g_f = 0.7

# P(I/G)
p_g_i = 0.2

p_g_text = p_g * p_g_f * p_g_i
print(p_g_text)

p_f_i = p_j_text + p_g_text
print('Probability of words freedom and immigration being said are: {}'.format(p_f_i))

'''
Instructions:
    Compute P(J|F,I) using the formula P(J|F,I) = (P(J) * P(F|J) * P(I|J)) / P(F,I) and store it in a variable p_j_fi
'''

p_j_fi = p_j_text / p_f_i
print('The probability of Jill Stein saying the words Freedom and Immigration: {}'.format(p_j_fi))

'''
Instructions:
    Compute P(G|F,I) using the formula P(G|F,I) = (P(G) * P(F|G) * P(I|G)) / P(F,I) and store it in a variable p_g_fi
'''
p_g_fi = p_g_text / p_f_i
print('The probability of Gary Johnson saying the words Freedom and Immigration: {}'.format(p_g_fi))
